<h1>Authority Before Execution</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Rethinking Responsibility in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</p>

<p>
Artificial intelligence systems increasingly shape real-world outcomes.
From risk assessment to recommendation engines that influence human behavior,
AI has moved beyond a passive analytical role. It participates. It affects. It acts.
</p>

<p>
Public discourse often centers on performance, bias, transparency, and explainability.
While essential, these concerns orbit a deeper structural question:
<strong>authority</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Not merely how intelligent systems decide, but under whose authority they execute.
</p>

<h2>Decision Is Not Execution</h2>

<p>
In human systems, a fundamental distinction exists between decision formation and execution.
Authority bridges that separation.
</p>

<p>
A recommendation may be evaluated, revised, or rejected.  
Execution alters reality.
</p>

<p>
Contemporary AI systems frequently collapse these layers.
Algorithmic outputs are increasingly treated as executable by default,
with review mechanisms activated only after consequences emerge.
</p>

<p>
Oversight in such models documents events retrospectively.
It does not determine whether execution should occur in the first place.
</p>

<h2>The Structural Question of Authority</h2>

<p>
The prevailing assumption in many digital systems is that capability implies permission.
If a system can decide, it may act.
</p>

<p>
Authority Before Execution proposes a structural separation:
decision logic and execution authority should not reside within the same operational layer.
</p>

<p>
Execution becomes conditional rather than automatic.
</p>

<h2>Architectural Model</h2>

<p>
This framework introduces a layered separation between:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Decision Generation Layer</li>
<li>Independent Authority Layer</li>
<li>Execution Environment</li>
</ul>

<p>
The authority layer precedes execution and operates independently from
the system generating the decision.
Its function is not to explain decisions, but to authorize, defer, modify,
or block execution.
</p>

<h3>Conceptual Flow</h3>

<pre>
Decision Generation
        ↓
Independent Authority Layer
        ↓
Execution
</pre>

<p>
This separation repositions responsibility from retrospective accountability
to pre-execution governance.
</p>

<h2>An Open Question</h2>

<p>
As AI systems gain influence and operational autonomy,
the absence of authority may represent a greater systemic risk
than the absence of transparency.
</p>

<p>
Not every decision should be executed simply because it can.
</p>

<p>
The unresolved question is not whether AI can decide,
but who — or what — must authorize its actions before they occur.
