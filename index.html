    <article>
      <p>Artificial intelligence systems increasingly shape real-world outcomes. From risk assessment to recommendation engines that influence human behavior, AI has moved beyond a passive role. It participates. It affects. It acts.</p>

      <p>Public discussion often focuses on performance, bias, transparency, or explainability. These are important questions. Yet they orbit a deeper issue that remains largely unaddressed: <strong>authority</strong>.</p>

      <p class="tight">Not how intelligent systems decide — but <strong>under whose authority they act</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Decision Is Not Execution</h2>
      <p>In human systems, a distinction exists between making a decision and executing it. Authority bridges that gap.</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p class="tight">A recommendation can be debated.</p>
        <p class="tight">An execution changes reality.</p>
      </div>

      <p>AI systems blur this distinction. Algorithmic decisions are increasingly treated as executable by default — implemented automatically and reviewed only after consequences appear. Oversight, when it exists, often begins <strong>after execution</strong>, when outcomes have already occurred.</p>

      <p class="tight">The assumption seems to be that intelligence justifies action. That capability implies permission.</p>

      <h2>Oversight Is Not Control</h2>
      <p>Many governance approaches rely on auditability. Decisions are logged, systems are monitored, accountability is assigned post-hoc. This creates the appearance of control without exercising it.</p>

      <p>Oversight after the fact documents what happened. It does not determine <strong>whether it should have happened</strong>.</p>

      <p class="tight">Responsibility is reconstructed rather than enforced.</p>

      <h2>The Limits of “Human in the Loop”</h2>
      <p><em>Human in the loop</em> is often presented as a safeguard. In practice, it frequently legitimizes execution rather than governs it.</p>

      <p>When human involvement occurs only at approval — without real authority to block, defer, or reshape execution — presence is mistaken for control.</p>

      <p class="tight">True authority requires the ability to <strong>withhold execution</strong>.</p>

      <h2>A Shift in Perspective</h2>
      <p>What if the core question is not how to explain AI decisions, but how to <strong>authorize them</strong>?</p>

      <p>What if execution were conditional, not automatic?</p>

      <p class="tight">This is not a technical proposal. It is a conceptual shift — from retrospective accountability to <strong>pre-execution responsibility</strong>.</p>

      <h2>An Open Question</h2>
      <p>As AI systems gain power, the absence of authority may represent a greater risk than the absence of transparency.</p>

      <p>Not every decision should be executed simply because it can.</p>

      <p class="tight">The unresolved question is not whether AI can decide — but <strong>who, or what, must authorize its actions before they occur</strong>.</p>
