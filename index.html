    <h1>Authority Before Execution</h1>
    <h2>Rethinking Responsibility in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence systems increasingly shape real-world outcomes.
      From risk assessment to recommendation engines that influence human behavior,
      AI has moved beyond a passive role. It participates. It affects. It acts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public discussion often focuses on performance, bias, transparency, or explainability.
      These are important questions. Yet they orbit a deeper issue that remains largely unaddressed:
      <strong>authority</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not how intelligent systems decide but under whose authority they act.
    </p>

    <h3>Decision Is Not Execution</h3>

    <p>
      In human systems, a distinction exists between making a decision and executing it.
      Authority bridges that gap.
    </p>

    <p>A recommendation can be debated.</p>
    <p>An execution changes reality.</p>

    <p>
      AI systems blur this distinction. Algorithmic decisions are increasingly treated as executable
      by default implemented automatically and reviewed only after consequences appear.
      Oversight, when it exists, often begins after execution, when outcomes have already occurred.
    </p>

    <p>
      The assumption seems to be that intelligence justifies action.
      That capability implies permission.
    </p>

    <h3>Oversight Is Not Control</h3>

    <p>
      Many governance approaches rely on auditability.
      Decisions are logged, systems are monitored, accountability is assigned post-hoc.
      This creates the appearance of control without exercising it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oversight after the fact documents what happened.
      It does not determine whether it should have happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Responsibility is reconstructed rather than enforced.
    </p>

    <h3>The Limits of “Human in the Loop”</h3>

    <p>
      Human in the loop is often presented as a safeguard.
      In practice, it frequently legitimizes execution rather than governs it.
    </p>

    <p>
      When human involvement occurs only at approval without real authority
      to block, defer, or reshape execution, presence is mistaken for control.
    </p>

    <p>
      True authority requires the ability to withhold execution.
    </p>

    <h3>A Shift in Perspective</h3>

    <p>
      What if the core question is not how to explain AI decisions,
      but how to authorize them?
    </p>

    <p>What if execution were conditional, not automatic?</p>

    <p>
      This is not a technical proposal.
      It is a conceptual shift from retrospective accountability
      to pre-execution responsibility.
    </p>

    <h3>An Open Question</h3>

    <p>
      As AI systems gain power, the absence of authority may represent a greater risk
      than the absence of transparency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not every decision should be executed simply because it can.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unresolved question is not whether AI can decide
      but who, or what, must authorize its actions before they occur.
